## Introduction

## Background

## Methodology & Analysis

## Results
The expected change in log of y with respect to a one-unit increase in x1 holding all other variables at any fixed value

* The results show that most airbnb account settings are significant at the 0.05 level except for bed types and parking. 
* The variable that had the strongest effect on the price per night is renting out the entire property, with a increase in the price per night by 2.24 times when compared to renting out a shared room while controlling for others.
* An interesting conclusion found was that smoking did not seem to have an affect on the price per night as the coeffecient is close to 1.
