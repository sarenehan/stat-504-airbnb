<!-- your names;
the title of the project;
a brief description of the research question, identifying whether it has inferential or predictive objectives;
a brief but clear and complete description of the associated data set that includes:
data collection process (e.g., describe the sample or experimental design),
units of measurement for all variables,
data structure (e.g., if your data are on 50 U.S. states with the sample size of 354, explain where the number 354 is coming from);
a clear identification of the outcome variable;
a brief description of any unusual methodological aspects that are already apparent (e.g., homoscedasticity, outliers, or dependent data structure);
a few key references.
The entire project proposal, including references, should not exceed one double-sided page in a normal size font (12pts).  -->
